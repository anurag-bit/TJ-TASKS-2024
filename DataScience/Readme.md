### **Task Title:**
**"Analyzing and Predicting Housing Prices"**

---

### **Objective:**
The goal is to analyze a dataset of housing prices, extract meaningful insights, and build a machine learning model to predict the price of a house based on given features.

---

### **Dataset:**
Provide a dataset like the [Kaggle Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) or generate a synthetic dataset with features such as:
- House size (sqft)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Location (city or neighborhood)
- Year built
- Lot size
- Distance to city center
- Property type (apartment, villa, etc.)
- Price

---

### **Steps to Complete the Task:**

#### **1. Data Exploration and Understanding**
   - Load the dataset and display the first few rows.
   - Provide basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numeric columns.
   - Check for missing values and inconsistent data types.
   - Visualize the distribution of key features such as house size, price, and number of bedrooms.

#### **2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
   - Convert categorical features (e.g., property type, location) into numerical values using encoding techniques.
   - Normalize or standardize numeric columns if required.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).

#### **3. Data Visualization**
   - Create scatter plots to examine the relationships between features (e.g., house size vs. price).
   - Use heatmaps to visualize correlations among numerical variables.
   - Plot price distributions across different property types or locations.

#### **4. Build a Predictive Model**
   - Use regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
   - Train the model on the training dataset.
   - Evaluate the model on the testing dataset using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared.

#### **5. Feature Engineering (Optional)**
   - Create new features (e.g., price per square foot, age of the house).
   - Perform feature selection to identify the most influential variables.

#### **6. Report Insights**
   - Summarize key insights from your analysis (e.g., factors that influence house prices the most).
   - Compare the performance of different models if multiple are attempted.
   - Provide suggestions for improving the model or handling similar datasets in the future.

### **Deliverables:**
- **Code:** A well-documented Jupyter Notebook or Python script with clear explanations for each step.
- **Visualization:** Graphs and plots for data analysis and model evaluation.
- **Report:** A brief summary of findings, the model used, and its performance.
- **Predictions:** A CSV file containing predicted prices for a given test dataset (if applicable).

---

### **Evaluation Criteria:**
- Correctness and completeness of the analysis.
- Clarity and quality of visualizations.
- Model accuracy and error metrics.
- Code readability and documentation.
- Insights and actionable recommendations derived from the data.
